`Career:

Ride formed a hip hop group called Fyre with his brother and a rapper named Young G. This group ended when his brother got married, and because of that, he wasn’t able to keep performing with the group. Also, he had been pursuing painting as a career too.

In 2010, he and his neighbor Zach Hill formed the group Death Grips with Hill’s friend Andy Morin who produced for the group with him. The group then released their debut self-titled EP in March 2011. A month later, Exmilitary was released. The record received critical acclaim. After that, they signed to Epic Records in 2012 and released their debut album, The Money Store, receiving more critical acclaim.

In 2012, Epic Records wanted to wait until 2013 to release their album, No Love Deep Web. So, they decided to leak the album, and the label dropped them. So they released Government Plates under their own label, Third Worlds Records. After that, they released the first half of their double album, The Powers That B in 2014.

However, on July 2, 2014, they announced that they would be disbanding, posting an image with the announcement written on a napkin on Twitter, announcing that they would be breaking up, but will still release the rest of The Powers That B. They finally released the entirety of The Powers That B in March 31, 2015.

In May 2016, after they allegedly disbanded, they released the album Bottomless Pit. After that, they released their EP Steroids (Crouching Tiger Hidden Gabber Megamix) in 2017. Finally, they released their final album to date, Year of the Snitch, and released their final project to date, Gmail and the Restraining Orders in 2019.

Art:

Ride has a very aggressive style of rapping, including powerful, abrasive screams and yells, being described as “a visceral and poetic form of rapping, resembling a blend of hardcore punk and spoken word performance,” as well as “paint-peeling barks and startling yelps.” Also, he creates art as a side career, making portraits that are dark and monochromatic.

Personal Life:

Even though Ride raps very aggressively in his songs, he seems very soft-spoken and shy in interviews with him. Also, he has stated that he is a very private individual, stating that, “I have very few people that I call my friends. I'm very distrustful of human beings in general; I'm very distrustful of media. I have no interest in sharing my personal life with the world. Zero.”

In addition, Ride has many various tattoos, most of which have dark and Satanic imagery. Some of which being a “111” on his stomach, skulls, spiders, pentagrams, voodoo symbols, a raven, and the word “Death.”

`It was a normal evening, I just got back from bass practice, and I take a look at my phone to check the time. But I noticed something strange: there was a mysterious new app on my phone.

I did not remember installing this app before, so I curiously opened it up, and on the screen suddenly appeared a timer counting down from 24 hours. I suddenly got really frightened, so I immediately closed out of the app, or at least I tried to. When I tried to swipe the app up, it would not move. Closing my other apps worked, but this one just would not budge. And now, there was the counting down timer stuck in the dynamic island at the top of my phone.`

export const APP_NARRATIVE_2 =
`So now I was frightened, but I realized that I still have 24 hours until something bad can happen. So, I went to sleep and hoped that I would have some kind of dream that would give me a solution.

I did not have some kind of dream that gave me a solution. It was bad. So now I was left with 15 hours left to come up with what this thing could possibly be, and how to fix this. However, it then suddenly came to me. THIS IS DEFINITELY A BOMB. I might be seriously in danger. But who would possibly do this to me? I pondered for a while, and I suddenly realized. FRANK.

For context, a while ago, all the way back in Elementary school, I had this one bully who was named Frank. He always pushed me onto the floor every Wednesday really hard. And it hurt. So, on the last day of fifth grade, I took a bottle of honey to school and squirted honey all over him and he became super sticky for the rest of the day. He went to a different middle school, so he probably still hated me ever since. Because of this, I guess he installed this onto my phone for revenge.

Now that I know that my phone is probably gonna blow up once it counts down to zero, I decided to spend the rest of my day doing some of the things I’ve always wanted to accomplish because you never know how severe a bomb could be. So, I went over and started as many things left on my bucket list as possible. First, I wanted to skydive. So, I bought a plane from my local plane store, as well as a parachute from the parachute store next door, both costing around 50,000 dollars in total. Just kidding, I don’t have enough money. I just constructed my own parachute out of trash bags and tape.

I went on my neighbor’s trampoline with my parachute, and bounced as high as I possibly could. Then I bounced above the entire trampoline, and gently landed with my parachute, as I slammed into the ground face-first. I guess that counted as skydiving. Check! The next thing on my list was to go to a concert. But there were no concerts today that had any tickets available to buy, so I had to create my own concert. I flicked the light switch in my room on and off rapidly. Then I “danced,” just randomly flailing my arms and legs quickly, blasting music. Good enough for a concert. Check!

The next thing after that was to make my own pizza. I went over to the store, bought some dough, went back home, realized I didn’t have tomato sauce, went back to the store, realized I didn’t have cheese, went back, and realized I didn’t have any toppings or anything, and finally got everything. Now that I had all the supplies I needed, I molded the dough into a circle, poured the entire can of tomato sauce onto the pizza dough, poured the entire bag of cheese and all of the toppings straight onto there as well, and then realized that I did not have a pizza oven. But it’s fine because I have a microwave! I threw it into the microwave for 3 minutes at max heat, and let it cook. When I checked on it when it was done, it was all black. I took it out, almost burned my fingerprints off, and took a bite. It actually wasn’t that bad! Just kidding, it was horrible. I had to vomit it all out. But suddenly, I heard beeping from my phone in my pocket.

I quickly pulled out my phone, checking the dynamic island, and there was the timer, counting down from ten seconds, with the text flashing red and white. This was it. I was absolutely cooked. More cooked than the pizza that I had just burned. I was about to blow up, and I had to think of something fast. Time was ticking, beep, seven seconds left, beep, six, beep, five. I needed to think of a solution. IMMEDIATELY. Two seconds were left, and I just decided to chuck the phone as hard as I could towards the window right next to me, hoping that it would break the glass and go through, but the worst thing happened. It bounced back off the window, back over to right in front of my feet.

I was about to blow up into smithereens, I saw my life flashing before my eyes. And as the timer finally counted down to zero seconds, the timer text became a solid red, and a high pitched tone played. This was truly the end, until green confetti started spontaneously spraying from my phone, up towards me. The confetti covered my face, and it stuck to my face. Astonished, I wiped all of it off my face and looked down at my phone. It said,

“Happy birthday! Sorry I couldn’t make it to celebrate your birthday this year, I have been too busy. So, I installed this app on your phone to count down from yesterday, so that I could still celebrate your birthday without me being there! Happy birthday again, son!

Love, Mom.”

I’ve never hated my mom more in my entire life than at that moment.`

I was about 6 years old, and I lived in a tiny neighborhood of about ten houses, having a large hill that goes downwards, and a cul-de-sac at the end. Since riding down the hill caused you to go down very fast, I liked to frequently bike up it and zoom down the hill afterwards.`

`One ordinary evening, I was biking, and my mom was with me. Because I wanted to show her how fast I could travel on this little bike, I rode up, started to bike down, and accelerated rapidly down the hill. I then looked back at my mom while biking down (don’t do this), and as a result, I didn’t see that I had to turn left slightly. So, I braked too hard, fell off the bike, and landed straight onto the asphalt with my face.

Therefore, my face was now torn up, and I had to be taken back inside. My face was torn up, and I was crying a lot. Because of this injury, my grandpa had to apply some sort of tonic to my face. This made the pain even worse. This resulted in me being in a state of agony for the next hour.

I still had to go to kindergarten, of course, with my half-bruised face. Even though I lowkey felt really cool with this face, my kindergarten teacher had to ask my mom if she was abusing me because of it. In conclusion, if you fall off your bike at 15 miles per hour because you got distracted, it results in negative consequences. Pay attention when biking.`

You might have heard of the graphic novel, American Born Chinese, because it’s pretty popular and got a TV adaptation on Disney+. However, should you actually read it?`

export const ABC_REVIEW_2 =

American Born Chinese is a graphic novel written and illustrated by Gene Luen Yang, with 240 pages. If that’s too many pages for you for whatever reason or you hate the author or something, then I guess don’t read it? Anyways, basically there’s this divine being called the Monkey King, who is a king of many monkeys, this Chinese kid called Jin Wang who is trying to fit in at school, and this white kid called Danny who is in high school and has to face the embarrassment of having to be with his super obnoxious annoying Chinese stereotype representing being named Chin-Kee. These three characters have different stories that alternate every chapter and will eventually have some sort of connection to each other. Now what do I think of this book? I think that this book is actually really great. The author did a great job coming up with this story and illustrating it, and I think that the plot is very interesting and is also very entertaining. It gets especially interesting near the end. So, read this.

One fine evening, I woke up from my nap. I went to talk to my mom, asking her, “What’s for dinner, Mom?”`

Then, she randomly started speaking Persian, saying “صبر کن تو پسر من نیستی! من هم نمی دانم شما چه می گویید.” Then I realized that the shenanigans I did yesterday throwing chocolate cakes onto people’s heads caused me to teleport to Iran. I was bamboozled! I thought, I might as well learn some Persian. So I took Mom’s phone, jumped out the house, installed some random language learning app, and learned two words in Persian. I am completely fluent now! I felt super bodacious. So then I went out in public and said some random stuff to some random guy. “Brouhaha!” he exclaimed. “این مرد سعی می کند فارسی بداند، اما در واقع یک احمق است!” I had no idea what he said, but then I saw some other random guy start canoodling with him out in public. So then I pulled out my skateboard out of my left pocket, and started doing some gnarly tricks. Everyone was goggling at me, since my tricks were so good. I started to feel included in Iran! Then my mom came running after me, so I skated away. She screamed, “تو برگرد اینجا پسر کوچولو!” I started hurling some gubbins at her, until I escaped to Afghanistan.
